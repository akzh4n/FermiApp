# FermiApp

# Fermi - the project is a mobile application for full-fledged training, in it all the details from the convenience to the most necessary information on the selected topic. It can be used by absolutely everyone who wants, but of course it is recommended for many students or schoolchildren who want to advance the scope of their knowledge.
# At the beginning it consists of only two basic subject such as Physics


# We have started working by our project, and you see files of app.
# Firstly you can only see the "Register/Login" form, by adding it we still working on design.


# Next step, we added main menu with user profile.
# By this way, we have created a lot of things like "Topics, Practice, Tables" of course.
# But there are were problems with old design, we had to change and add new things.
# We completely did that, but as you can see there are lack of such problems, but we are going to fix it.
